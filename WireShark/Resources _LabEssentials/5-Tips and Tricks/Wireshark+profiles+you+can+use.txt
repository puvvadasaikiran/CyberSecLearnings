My friend Jeff Carell told me about this website that has a lot of Wireshark profiles.

Jeff and others have created some cool Wireshark profiles to make it easier to find information.

Please note that I have no affiliation with this website and you use these at your own risk. Follow their advice: "You should unzip a zipped profile and make sure it only contains TXT files."
